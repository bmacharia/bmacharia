# Hi, Iâ€™m Babu ðŸ‘‹
I build cloud-native platforms with Kubernetes, GitOps, and automationâ€”focused on reliability, developer velocity, and AI/LLM workload readiness.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
AWS Â· Kubernetes (K3s/K3d) Â· Docker Â· Terraform Â· FluxCD Â· GitHub Actions Â· Prometheus/Grafana/Loki Â· Python/Go/Bash

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects
### Production Kubernetes Cluster (pi-cluster)
- GitOps with FluxCD and Kustomize; 100% environment consistency
- Observability with Prometheus/Grafana; MTTR improvement
- Edge-ready with Raspberry Pi and K3s; AI/LLM inference readiness
Repo: https://github.com/bmacharia/pi-cluster

### CI/CD Pipeline Automation (devops-study-app)
- End-to-end GitHub Actions: lint (Ruff), test (PyTest), scan (Trivy), release (Release Please)
- DevContainers for standardized developer environments
- K3d deployment validation with zero-downtime rollout patterns
Repo: https://github.com/bmacharia/devops-study-app
